I am a scientist, and like a very large number of scientists, I’ve become increasingly concerned about the reckless cuts to the federal government. Unlike a very large number of scientists, however, I was born and raised here in Bluffton (BHS ‘15). To save money, I worked my way through college at (I)PFW and graduated in 2019 with my degree in Chemistry. While at PFW, I had the opportunity to conduct chemistry research on campus, as well as places including Argonne National Lab in Illinois and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The latter was part of a set of programs operated by the National Science Foundation called “Research Experience[s] for Undergraduates” or REUs. These programs aimed to help students like me (not at a fancy school or with connected parents) experience scientific research at large institutions. Importantly, it also provided a small stipend so that I could afford to take work leave for 8 weeks. That REU convinced me to do science, and I look back on it fondly as I finish up my Ph.D. in Chemistry. Unfortunately, the same opportunities may not exist for current or future college students. Recent slashes to the NSF have caused the cancellation of REUs across the county, including the Chemistry REU at the University of Michigan.   

I understand the feeling that cuts to the federal government won’t affect Bluffton, but I also know that’s not true. These half-planned cuts are beginning, but eventually they’ll harm us all. Let me give a few examples. In January, Senator Todd Young introduced the TORNADO Act which would require the National Weather Service to upgrade their tornado-forecasting technology and require them to better share their data and damage assessments with local organizations after tornadoes occur. These are issues that affect all of us, but the National Weather Service’s organization is now in the crosshairs of DOGE. How much can this bill accomplish if meteorologists are fired? Even locally, BHMSD and Southern Wells receive ~$500k in annual Title 1 funding from the Department of Education. What happens if that stops? Almost 20% of Wells County is covered by Medicaid. What happens to Bluffton Regional Medical Center if that funding gets slashed? And on a broader scale, what happens if hundreds of thousands of job losses put us into a recession? I don’t know the answers and I hope we don’t have to find out, because there’s one thing I can promise: I care about Wells County more than Donald Trump or Elon Musk ever will. If you do too, consider calling up Todd Young’s Fort Wayne office at (317) 226-6700 and telling him that these services matter to you.
