I like to share Springsteen Songs of the Moment on Bluesky, and the selection process is usually no more than "have I been listening to this song nonstop lately?" This time, I found myself doing that with "The Big Muddy" from 1992's 'Lucky Town'. 

I would not put "The Big Muddy" in my top 10 of Boss songs, but I think one could argue that it's a centerpiece of his discography from a thematic and lyrical view.

On the surface, it's a song that criticizes the moral erosion of society. I see this as similar to 1973's "Lost in the Flood". The first verse is about a little bit of light adultery that "didn't hurt nobody" but that nonetheless ends "waist deep in the big muddy", where "you start out standing but end up crawlin'". 

Verse two is a more ambiguous.
