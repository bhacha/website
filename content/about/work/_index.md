These are a couple of projects that have already been completed. For obvious reasons, current work is not shared here until published or presented. In general, my focus is on using additive manufacturing methods (like 3D-printing) to create photonic/phononic crystals. We hope that additive manufacturing will allow for unprecedented control in the creation of defects and other discontinuities in these structures, which are the locations where the most interesting physics occur!
