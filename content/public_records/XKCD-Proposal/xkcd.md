math: true

Randall Munroe from xkcd shared on Bluesky that he received a satirical response to a comic in which he proposed flattening the planets in the solar system. Although the response was a joke, I figured there was an internal "paper trail" at NASA that led to its creation. These are the emails that came up with the whole thing.
