In 2022, Donald J. Trump claimed that he helped Georgia Governor Ron DeSantis win re-election by using the FBI to stop election fraud in Broward County, GA. This had not been previously reported, so I filed a FOIA request for agency records. The FBI responded by saying no records about this were found. This matches the [NBC News story](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fbi-says-no-records-related-trumps-claim-sent-agents-stop-voter-fraud-rcna74965), which also received a response dated March 6, 2023.
