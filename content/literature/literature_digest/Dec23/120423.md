summary: "Featuring a structural color, electronic color, 3D-printing, and a history of fluorophores"
---

As I start to compile these, I get a little self-conscious about how the date distribution works. I think a lot of the time it corresponds to "release dates" of journal ASAPs or Issues, but maybe it's really a window into my daily mood? 

Anyway, there's some neat colors and 3D printing in this week's digest. Maybe someday I'll take the time to give my opinions on all the articles I share. I think the first priority is to get the thumbnails going, but I'm afraid it's going to be tedious.

Sorry, enough with the monologue. In the words of Stephen A. Smith: "TAke a look, y'all":
