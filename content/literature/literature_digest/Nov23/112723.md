This is a short batch of some papers I found to be interesting. With the Thanksgiving holiday, I compiled this on Monday the 27th. As such, there's a bit of a bias towards the more recent publications. It's also a shorter list than I hope to have in the future! Nonetheless, here's the Literature Digest:

------
### Vortex nanolaser based on a photonic disclination cavity

##### *Nov. 27, 2023 -- by Min-Soo Hwang, Ha-Reem Kim, Jungkil kim, Bohm-Jung Yang, Yuri Kivshar, and Hong-Gyu Park*
